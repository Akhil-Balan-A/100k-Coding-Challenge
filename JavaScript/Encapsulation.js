// Encapsulation
/*What it is: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within one unit (object/class)
Why it is: Prevents external code from directly accessing internal state, reducing bugs
When it's used: When you need data protection and controlled access

// With ordinary functions(means using closures)



// With getters and setters (using get and set functions)
